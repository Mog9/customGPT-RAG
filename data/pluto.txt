Pluto is a Streamlit-based no-code machine learning tool that allows users to train models directly in the browser without writing any code. It enables users to upload any CSV dataset, automatically detect the type of machine learning task—either classification or regression—visualize key data insights, and train models instantly. The project is designed to simplify the entire machine learning workflow, making it accessible to users without any programming experience.

When a user uploads a CSV file, Pluto automatically inspects and displays important details about the dataset such as its shape, column names, data types, missing values, and basic descriptive statistics. It then analyzes the target column to determine the task type. If the target column contains categorical values, the problem is identified as a classification task. If the target column is numeric, the problem is treated as a regression task. This automatic detection ensures that users can quickly begin training models without manual setup.

For classification problems, Pluto supports four core algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). For regression problems, the available algorithms include Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor. These algorithms were chosen to provide a good balance between simplicity, interpretability, and predictive performance.

Pluto also includes built-in visualization features that make it easy to compare model performances. It generates a bar plot showing metrics such as R² scores or accuracy for each model. The best-performing model is visually highlighted, allowing users to quickly understand which algorithm worked best for their data. This makes the process of model evaluation both intuitive and interactive.

During the training process, Pluto automatically splits the uploaded dataset into training and testing subsets. It then trains all relevant models based on the detected task type and evaluates their performance using appropriate metrics. For classification tasks, it reports metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices, while for regression tasks, it reports the R² score and other relevant evaluation statistics.

The Pluto ML Project is built using Streamlit for the user interface, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and numpy for numerical operations. Together, these technologies create a seamless and efficient browser-based environment for machine learning experimentation.

For example, when a user uploads the popular iris dataset, Pluto automatically recognizes it as a classification problem, trains the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN models, compares their results, and highlights the best-performing one through a color-coded bar chart. This fully automated workflow allows users to focus on insights rather than technical setup.

Overall, the goal of Pluto is to offer a complete no-code machine learning environment that enables anyone—regardless of technical expertise—to explore datasets, visualize data, and train models directly in the browser. It emphasizes simplicity, automation, and accessibility while maintaining the flexibility and power of modern machine learning tools.
