Transformers are the core architecture behind modern large language models (LLMs). Introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017’s “Attention is All You Need”, the transformer revolutionized NLP by replacing recurrent networks (RNNs) with a structure that can process entire sequences in parallel. This allowed models to scale massively and understand context over long passages of text.

The transformer architecture is built around two main blocks: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder reads and represents the input text, while the decoder generates the output (for example, a translation or a chatbot response). Models like BERT use only the encoder for understanding tasks, while GPT uses only the decoder for generating text. This flexibility is part of what makes transformers so powerful.

Transformers also rely heavily on embeddings and attention mechanisms to understand meaning and relationships between tokens. They enable models to handle long-range dependencies — like connecting the subject and verb in a long sentence — something earlier models struggled with. Almost every modern GenAI system today, from ChatGPT to Stable Diffusion (for text-to-image), is built on the transformer foundation.
